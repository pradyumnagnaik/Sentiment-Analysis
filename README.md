# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentimental analysis is a technique that uses natural language processing and machine learning to identify and extract the emotional states of the text. In this project, I have built a sentimental analysis model that can classify the sentiment as positive or negative.

# Classification of tweets from dataset

I have completed the task of sentiment analysis on the tweets from dataset. I have used different color boxes to indicate the sentiment of each tweet: green for positive, red for negative and yellow for neutral. This way, you can easily see the distribution of sentiments among the tweets and identify any patterns or trends.\
